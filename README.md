# Animal-Classifier
Building An Accurate And Efficient Animal Classification Application. <br/>
Training ML models to classify animals into one of 151 categories using the Animal dataset containing over 6000+ animal images.

## Code
The model is trained in Python using Jupyter Notebook and run in the Google Colab Environment.
The dataset can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_nn9bt9pn9rwWyWIG2vKf377O-C9Oa1b?usp=sharing

## Performance Measure
Accuracy is determined by using a function that computes the accuracy over the top-k predictions for the
specified values of k. For example, in top-3 accuracy the output is considered the ‘right answer’ if the right
answer appears in the top 3 guesses. Meanwhile, efficiency is determined using FLOPS (Floating-Point
Operations per Second). This is a unit of measurement used to quantify the computing power (Sheldon, R.2023). 
Efficiency is calculated by dividing accuracy by the FLOPS count.
